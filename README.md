osu! Replay Recorder
====================

Pass in a .osr replay, .osz map, and a filename for the .mpg video, and ideally it'd crank out a video. Still heavily under development, so nothing works. I have basically no background in graphics or video rendering, much less with complicated libraries like OpenGL and FFmpeg, so this is a learning project for me.

If you're looking for a (kind of) working copy, look in the `js-version` branch. That contains the version I wrote in Node.js before I started working on the C port. It can correctly render circles and sliders using @ko-tori's editorÂ¡nso lib, and output a pretty simplified video.

For this version, I'm planning to go all out with lots of customizations such as video size, customizing skin, etc. If you're familiar with development, by all means contact me using the information at the end of this document.

What is osu?
